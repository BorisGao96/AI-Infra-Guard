  cve: CVE-2025-2828
  summary: SSRF vulnerability in LangChain Community's RequestsToolkit component
  details: |
    A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the RequestsToolkit component of the langchain-community package (specifically, langchain_community.agent_toolkits.openapi.toolkit.RequestsToolkit) in langchain-ai/langchain version 0.0.27. This vulnerability occurs because the toolkit does not enforce restrictions on requests to remote internet addresses, allowing it to also access local addresses. As a result, an attacker could exploit this flaw to perform port scans, access local services, retrieve instance metadata from cloud environments (e.g., Azure, AWS), and interact with servers on the local network.
